## PROJECT- Hospital Readmission Prediction & Analysis using Diabetes Dataset

## Objective: 
The goal of this project is to analyze and predict hospital readmission patterns among diabetic patients using a real-world healthcare dataset.
It combines Data Analytics and Machine Learning to identify the key medical and demographic factors that contribute to frequent hospital readmissions. The system provides data driven insights that can help healthcare institutions reduce operational costs, optimize resource allocation and improve patient care outcomes.

## Dataset:
- Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008
- 101766 rows | 50 columns


## Key Questions:

- What percentage of diabetic patients get readmitted and how soon?
- Do factors like prior hospital visits, medication changes or comorbidities (other health conditions) influence the likelihood of readmission?
- Which patient demographics (age, gender, race) show higher readmission tendencies?
- Can a predictive model accurately forecast whether a patient is likely to be readmitted?

## Scope of Analysis:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Hypothesis testing for statistical significance
- Visualization of trends and relationships
- Model Building
- Evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning
