# PROJECT-Hospital-Readmission-Analysis
Introduction: Hospital Readmission Analysis using Diabetes Dataset
Objective: The goal of this project is to analyze hospital readmission patterns among diabetic patients using a real-world healthcare dataset. The focus is on identifying key factors that contribute to frequent hospital returns and understanding how clinical and demographic variables affect readmission rates.

Key Questions:

What percentage of diabetic patients get readmitted, and how soon?
Do factors like prior hospital visits, medication changes, or comorbidities (other health conditions) influence the likelihood of readmission?
Which patient demographics (age, gender, race) show higher readmission tendencies?
Scope of Analysis:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Hypothesis testing for statistical significance
Visualization of trends and relationships
Insights summarization for actionable outcomes
Expected Outcome: The analysis aims to reveal clinical and operational patterns that can help hospitals and healthcare professionals reduce readmission rates, improve diabetic care management, and allocate resources more effectively.

Tools & Libraries:

Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Statistics: SciPy
Kaggle Notebook for analysis workflow
